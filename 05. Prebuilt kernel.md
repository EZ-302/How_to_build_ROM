# 0 See my kernel tree for reference

I use **ginkgo** device and here is my kernel tree.

	$
	https://github.com/LeCmnGend/kernel_xiaomi_ginkgo/tree/super-R	

My superior kernel branch is super-R, so move to this branch.

# 1 Edit build script (*.sh file)

Normally, each kernel have it build script it self.

Mine are **b15.sh**

Add this to your kernel build script.

	$
	function create_prebuilt {
		#Copy Image.gz and dtbo.img to prebuilt folder
		mkdir -p prebuilt
		cp out/arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz-dtb prebuilt
		cp out/arch/arm64/boot/dtbo.img prebuilt
		rm -rf out
		make clean
	}

# 2 Run build script

Run build to have prebuilt kernel.
Mine prebuilt kernel are in kernel/prebuilt folder
