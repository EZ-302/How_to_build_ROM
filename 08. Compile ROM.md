# Basic command:

Move to your rom folder and set environment: (mine /root/super)
----------------------

    $ cd ~/super

    $ . build/envsetup.sh
  
 
 Lunch your device: (mine **ginkgo** on **superior** rom)
 ---------------------
  
    $ lunch superior_ginkgo-userdebug
  
  
 Make ROM: 
  ---------------------
  
 (mine 8 core 16 process so i want compile with maximum core -j16)

  
    $ make bacon -j16 | tee ~/super/build.log-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H').txt
  
 Some other different:
 
    $ mka bacon -j16  | tee ~/super/build.log-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H').txt
  
 Check error 
 ---------------
 
 in ~/super folder, this is the most painful part to make a compiler work
 
 # If Success
 
 Your rom should be in the /super/out/target/product/ginkgo
