# 01.Setup DNS Server

Turn off generation of /etc/resolv.conf
Using your Linux prompt, (I'm using Ubuntu), modify (or create) /etc/wsl.conf with the following content
(Can simple type *sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf* then *ctrl + O* to save, and *Ctrl+X* to exit)

```
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
```



# 02. Restart the WSL2 Virtual Machine

Exit all of your Linux prompts and run the following Powershell command

```
wsl --shutdown
```

# 03. Create a custom /etc/resolv.conf

Open a new Linux prompt and cd to /etc

If resolv.conf is soft linked to another file, remove then re-create the link with
(rm command can cause *rm: cannot remove '/etc/resolv.conf': No such file or directory* , you can safety ignore it)
```
sudo rm -rf /etc/resolv.conf
echo nameserver 1.1.1.1 > /etc/resolv.conf
```
# 04. Restart WSL again
