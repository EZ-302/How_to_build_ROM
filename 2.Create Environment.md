# Move cache folder

The fact that when build on windows, i have 2 drive (C (ssd,only 240Gb) and D (hdd 1Tb)), 
so wsl2 folder in drive D, but cache and ccache need to be in drive C for speed:
** change /e/ to /c/ (my E drive is ssd too)
     
	$ sudo mv -v ~/.cache /mnt/e/.ccache
	$ sudo ln -s /mnt/e/.ccache/.cache ~/.cache
