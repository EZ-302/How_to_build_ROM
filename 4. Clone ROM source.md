# 1. Some information

A full ROM need at least 4 parts:
Because it is the noob (blind copy paste guide) if your device dont have 2, 3, 4, then you will need
to create it by yourself (more complicated), see xda thread. 

  1. ROM build source (superior, crDroid, pixelOS, lineage,...)
  2. device source (ginkgo, violet,...)
  3. kernel source
  4. vendor source
  
# 2. Clone ROM source:

Goolge.com then find the rom source github (or gitlab) page you want to build
Example( Ea): Me really love Superior OS, so i find this on google:

       $ https://github.com/SuperiorOS
  
A ROM source should have a repo (project directory) with genera guide like
       $ manifest (super) or android (crDroid), ...
  
You can easily find it in the top of github (gh , gl for gitlap), read this describe to find.
Becareful select your branch you want to build, me want build 11.0 (eleven) so i select this branch.
Open it, it will show genera guide, all i need is the repo link of it:
  
       $ mkdir -p ~/super
       $ cd ~/super
       $ repo init -u https://github.com/SuperiorOS/manifest.git -b eleven
  
(See, i choose branch **(-b) eleven ** )

Copy then edit for some faster download (repo sync will copy all of it code include history (huge + very much time)
Finally link should like this:
  
       $ repo init -u https://github.com/SuperiorOS/manifest.git -b eleven --depth=1

(depth=1 mean only download the newest code from source)
Then type:
  
        $ makedir -p ~/super && chmod a+x ~/super
        $ cd ~/super
        $ repo init -u https://github.com/SuperiorOS/manifest.git -b eleven --depth=1 
 
Then download the source by type:
  
        $ repo sync -j1 --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags --optimized-fetch --fail-fast
  
It will fail when the first error occur (--fail-fast) for easy to debug error,
you need to find for this error then continue type repo sync.. again
(simply click **up arrow** on keyboard then it will show prev command)

# After sucess, open your /root/super and it should have many more folder (rom source) here, move to part 5
