# 1. Find your device source
  
  Some rom have include device support repo in it github (crDroid), just type **device name**
  (me type **ginkgo**)) to search repo, if your device show, *hula*, fork device, vendor, kernel.
  Some rom have separate device page, you should search it in goodle,
  Ea: superior have ROM source gh separate with DEVICE source:
  
    $ https://github.com/SuperiorOS 
  
  And DEVICE source:
    
    $ https://github.com/SuperiorOS-Devices

  If find both 3 repo of your device, move to 3,
  else move to 2.


# 2. Find your device source (without official support from ROM page)
  
  Open google then find your source (my phone is ginkgo)
  so i find  **ginkgo device github**
  I would like to choose the first search (most active)
  the fine link should have (device or android_device word + phone type + phone name): 
  
    $ https://github.com/**<dev-link>**/android_device_xiaomi_ginkgo  
    $ https://github.com/**<dev-link>**/device_xiaomi_ginkgo
  
  Click fork to fork it into your gh, you will be able to edit the project link
 i would like to name device source by this format:
    
  $ device_xiaomi_ginkgo
  
  So i can remember my link:
  
    $ github.com/*<my-gh-name>/device_xiaomi_ginkgo
    $ github.com/*<my-gh-name>/kernel_xiaomi_ginkgo
    $ github.com/*<my-gh-name>/vendor_xiaomi_ginkgo
  
 # 3. Clone device source
  
  Now i have 3 repo in my github (already redefined it name):
  
    $ https://github.com/LeCmnGend/device_xiaomi_ginkgo 
    $ https://github.com/LeCmnGend/kernel_xiaomi_ginkgo
    $ https://github.com/LeCmnGend/vendor_xiaomi_ginkgo
  
  3.1 Download device
  -----------------------
  
  Your ROM source wil have 3 folder (device, kernel, vendor) to place your code.
  Mine /root/super have:
  
    $ /root/super/device
    $ /root/super/kernel
    $ /root/super/vendor
    
  a. Download device
  -------------------
  
  Mine ginkgo producted by Xiaomi (your samsung, sony,...)
  so i will put my device in (do not skip this format):
  
    $ /root/super/device/xiaomi/ginkgo
    
  My
