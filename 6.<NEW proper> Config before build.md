# Me become more proper when build ROM too

Seen Google block hosttoolchain, it has their goal
(many more host toolchain we (noob) accidentally install like gcc, clang-10, which is very low version 
which mean less compatible, so it need to prevent these to cause weird error :-D)

# 1. Download clang toolchain to prebuilt folder

Me ROM source is ~/super, if your source is different, change it to fit, then run like: 

        $
        PTC_DIR=~/super/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/clang-proton
        git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/LeCmnGend/proton-clang $PTC_DIR
        
# 2. Add proton clang to device/BoardConfig.mk

Add this below DEVICE_PATH

                $ # Toolchain Config
                TARGET_KERNEL_CLANG_COMPILE := true
                TARGET_KERNEL_CLANG_VERSION := proton
                KERNEL_LD := LD=ld.lld
                TARGET_KERNEL_ADDITIONAL_FLAGS := LD=ld.lld AR=llvm-ar NM=llvm-nm OBJCOPY=llvm-objcopy OBJDUMP=llvm-objdump STRIP=llvm-strip
                TARGET_KERNEL_ADDITIONAL_FLAGS += HOSTCFLAGS="-fuse-ld=lld -Wno-unused-command-line-argument"
                TARGET_KERNEL_CLANG_PATH := $(shell pwd)/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/clang-$(TARGET_KERNEL_CLANG_VERSION)
